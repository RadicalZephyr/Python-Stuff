# The goal of this restructuring is to make the module easier to test
# and maintain.  This will be done in several ways.  Abstracting the
# data type used in storing file data into a class of it's own, that
# has input, output and modification methods.  Then, the filemoving
# class can just instantiate the data class, and have it handle how
# things get stored.
