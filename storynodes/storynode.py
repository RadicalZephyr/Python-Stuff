# Framework for a web-page based game (with Django?) where
# there's a continuous story.  When playing, you can only read
# the previous two lines (written by same person? or two different?)
# This would allow branching (but no merging?) esp. if two people are
# starting from the same 'prompt' sentences at the same time, and then
# each two sentence bit is a 'node' with pointers to other 'nodes'
# probably in list form.
# There should be functionality to pick a node to start from, to start a
# new thread (story), maybe to add a picture (like mel's game, picture words)
# alternating inspired by eachother.
